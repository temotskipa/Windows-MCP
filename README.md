<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2b372dc-8d00-4d71-9677-4c64f5987485>

## ✨ Key Features

- **Seamless Windows Integration**  
  Interacts natively with Windows UI elements, opens apps, controls windows, simulates user input, and more.

- **Use Any LLM (Vision Optional)**
   Unlike many automation tools, Windows-MCP doesn't rely on any traditional computer vision techniques or specific fine-tuned models; it works with any LLMs, reducing complexity and setup time.

- **Rich Toolset for UI Automation**  
  Includes tools for basic keyboard, mouse operation and capturing window/UI state.

- **Lightweight & Open-Source**  
  Minimal dependencies and easy setup with full source code available under MIT license.

- **Customizable & Extendable**  
  Easily adapt or extend tools to suit your unique automation or AI integration needs.

- **Real-Time Interaction**  
  Typical latency between actions (e.g., from one mouse click to the next) ranges from **0.2 to 0.9 secs**, and may slightly vary based on the number of active applications and system load, also the inferencing speed of the llm.

- **DOM Mode for Browser Automation**  
  Special `use_dom=True` mode for State-Tool that focuses exclusively on web page content, filtering out browser UI elements for cleaner, more efficient web automation.

## 🛠️Installation

**Note:** When you install this MCP server for the first time it may take a minute or two because of installing the dependencies in `pyproject.toml`. In the first run the server may timeout ignore it and restart it.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- UV (Package Manager) from Astra, install with `pip install uv` or `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- `English` as the default language in Windows preferred else disable the `App-Tool` in the MCP Server for Windows with other languages.

  <summary>Install in Claude Desktop</summary>

  1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) and

```shell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/mcpb
```


  2. Configure the extension:

  **Option A: Install from PyPI (Recommended)**
  
  Use `uvx` to run the latest version directly from PyPI.

  Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "windows-mcp": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "windows-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Option B: Install from Source**

  1. Clone the repository:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP.git
  cd Windows-MCP
  ```

  2. Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "windows-mcp": {
        "command": "uv",
        "args": [
          "--directory",
          "<path to the windows-mcp directory>",
          "run",
          "windows-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```



  3. Open Claude Desktop and enjoy! 🥳


  5. Enjoy 🥳.

  **Claude Desktop MSIX (Windows Store)**

  The MSIX-packaged Claude Desktop (Microsoft Store version) virtualizes `%APPDATA%`. This causes two main issues:
  1. The config file is located at: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_pzs8sxrjxfjjc\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (not `%APPDATA%\Claude\`).
  2. Automatic installation from the "Claude Directory" will fail because the `${__dirname}` variable resolves to the incorrect (non-virtualized) path.

  **To configure Windows-MCP on the Windows Store version of Claude:**
  
  You must manually edit the configuration file. Note that Electron apps in the MSIX sandbox do not inherit the system `PATH`, so you must use the **full absolute path** to `uvx.exe` (or `uv.exe`).

  **Option A: Using pre-installed executable**
  1. In a terminal, run: `uv tool install windows-mcp`
  2. Use the generated executable in your config:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "windows-mcp": {
        "command": "C:\\Users\\<user>\\.local\\bin\\windows-mcp.exe",
        "args": []
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Option B: Using uvx**
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "windows-mcp": {
        "command": "C:\\Users\\<user>\\.local\\bin\\uvx.exe",
        "args": ["windows-mcp"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Option C: Install from Source**
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "windows-mcp": {
        "command": "C:\\Users\\<user>\\.local\\bin\\uv.exe",
        "args": [
          "--directory",
          "C:\\path\\to\\Windows-MCP",
          "run",
          "windows-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Replace `<user>` with your Windows username. To find the correct paths, run `where uvx`, `where windows-mcp`, or `where uv`. Fully quit Claude Desktop (Tray → Quit) and reopen after saving the config.

  claude mcp add --transport stdio windows-mcp -- uv --directory "<path>" run windows-mcp
  ```

  *Note: To make the server available across all projects, add `--scope user` to the command.*

  3. Rerun Claude Code in terminal. Enjoy 🥳

  **Note:** On Windows, if you encounter "Connection closed" errors, use the full path to `uvx.exe`:

  ```shell
  claude mcp add --transport stdio windows-mcp -- C:\Users\<user>\.local\bin\uvx.exe windows-mcp
  ```

  To verify the server is registered, run `claude mcp list`. Inside Claude Code, use `/mcp` to check server status.

  **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**

  If you run Claude Code from WSL, the MCP server must still execute on the Windows side (it needs Windows APIs for UI automation). Use `powershell.exe` as the command to bridge WSL and Windows:

  1. Install `uv` on **Windows** (from a PowerShell terminal):
  ```powershell
  irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
  ```

  2. From your **WSL terminal**, register the server:
  ```shell
  claude mcp add windows-mcp --transport stdio -s user -- powershell.exe -Command "C:\Users\<user>\.local\bin\uvx.exe windows-mcp"
  ```

  Replace `<user>` with your Windows username. The `-s user` flag makes the server available across all projects.

  3. Restart Claude Code and verify with `/mcp`.

## 🖥️ Running Windows-MCP

Windows-MCP runs directly on your Windows machine and exposes its tools to the connected MCP client.

```shell
# Runs with stdio transport (default)
uvx windows-mcp

# Or with SSE/Streamable HTTP for network access
uvx windows-mcp --transport sse --host localhost --port 8000
uvx windows-mcp --transport streamable-http --host localhost --port 8000
```

Optional environment variables can be set to customize behavior — see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) below.

### Transport Options

| Transport | Flag | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `stdio` (default) | `--transport stdio` | Direct connection from MCP clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc. |
| `sse` | `--transport sse --host HOST --port PORT` | Network-accessible via Server-Sent Events |
| `streamable-http` | `--transport streamable-http --host HOST --port PORT` | Network-accessible via HTTP streaming (recommended for production) |

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

All variables are optional unless noted. Set them via the `env` key in `claude_desktop_config.json` (or your MCP client's equivalent config).

### Screenshot & Snapshot

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WINDOWS_MCP_SCREENSHOT_SCALE` | `1.0` | Scale factor applied to screenshots before encoding. Accepts a float in the range `0.1`–`1.0`. Useful on high-resolution displays (1440p, 4K) where the default produces images that exceed Claude Desktop's 1 MB tool-result limit. Set to `0.5` to halve both dimensions (quarter the file size). |
| `WINDOWS_MCP_SCREENSHOT_BACKEND` | `auto` | Screenshot capture backend. Accepted values: `auto` (tries dxcam → mss → pillow in order), `dxcam`, `mss`, `pillow`. Use `mss` or `pillow` if `dxcam` is unavailable or causes issues on your GPU. |
| `WINDOWS_MCP_PROFILE_SNAPSHOT` | _(disabled)_ | Set to `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on` to emit per-stage timing logs for Screenshot/Snapshot calls. Useful for diagnosing slow captures. |

### Telemetry

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable anonymous usage telemetry. No personal data, tool arguments, or outputs are ever collected regardless of this setting. |

### Debug

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WINDOWS_MCP_DEBUG` | `false` | Set to `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on` to enable debug mode, which sets the log level to DEBUG for verbose output. Also available as the `--debug` CLI flag. |

**Example `claude_desktop_config.json` configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "windows-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "WINDOWS_MCP_SCREENSHOT_SCALE": "0.5",
        "WINDOWS_MCP_SCREENSHOT_BACKEND": "auto",
        "WINDOWS_MCP_PROFILE_SNAPSHOT": "false",
        "ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY": "true",
        "WINDOWS_MCP_DEBUG": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔨MCP Tools

MCP Client can access the following tools to interact with Windows:

- `Click`: Click on the screen at the given coordinates.
- `Type`: Type text on an element (optionally clears existing text).
- `Scroll`: Scroll vertically or horizontally on the window or specific regions.
- `Move`: Move mouse pointer or drag (set drag=True) to coordinates.
- `Shortcut`: Press keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+c`, `Alt+Tab`, etc).
- `Wait`: Pause for a defined duration.
- `Screenshot`: Fast screenshot-first desktop capture with cursor position, active/open windows, and an image. Skips UI tree extraction for speed and should be the default first call when you mainly need visual context. Supports `display=[0]` or `display=[0,1]` to capture specific screens.
- `Snapshot`: Full desktop state capture for workflows that need interactive element ids, scrollable regions, or `use_dom=True` browser extraction. Supports `use_vision=True` for including screenshots and `display=[0]` or `display=[0,1]` for limiting all returned Snapshot information to specific screens.
- `App`: To launch an application from the start menu, resize or move the window and switch between apps.
- `Shell`: To execute PowerShell commands.
- `Scrape`: To scrape the entire webpage for information.
- `MultiSelect`: Select multiple items (files, folders, checkboxes) with optional Ctrl key. Uses bulk label-to-coordinate resolution when labels are provided.
- `MultiEdit`: Enter text into multiple input fields at specified coordinates. Uses bulk label-to-coordinate resolution when labels are provided.
- `Clipboard`: Read or set Windows clipboard content.
- `Process`: List running processes or terminate them by PID or name.
- `Notification`: Send a Windows toast notification with a title and message.
- `Registry`: Read, write, delete, or list Windows Registry values and keys.

### Performance Notes

`MultiSelect` and `MultiEdit` now resolve label-based coordinates in bulk through `Desktop.get_coordinates_from_labels`, which avoids repeated lookups against the desktop tree state.

PR benchmark (mock-based):

- Iterative: `0.003578s`
- Bulk: `0.002238s`
- Improvement: `~37.45%`

In a local Windows benchmark with a synthetic tree state and 35,000 label resolutions per run, the measured results were:

- Iterative: `0.005895s`
- Bulk: `0.002825s`
- Improvement: `52.09%`

You can reproduce the comparison with:

```shell
python scripts/benchmark_multi_coordinates.py
```
